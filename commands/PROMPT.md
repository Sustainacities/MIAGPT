The `/prompt` command is a Discord application command that allows users to update the behavior of the chat bot by providing text input. This command is designed to work with HeyMia's chat bot module, allowing users to customize the bot's responses.

## Usage

To use the `/prompt` command, type `/prompt` followed by your message. Your message should contain the text input that you want to use to update the chat bot's behavior.

## Output

After your message has been received, the chat bot will use your input to update its behavior. Depending on the complexity of your input, it may take some time for the chat bot to process the changes. Once the changes have been applied, you can test the updated behavior by using the chat bot in your server.

## Installation

To use the `/prompt` command, you will need to have a Discord bot set up and authorized on your server. Once you have set up your bot, you can add the `/prompt` command to your bot's application commands using the Discord Developer Portal.

## Conclusion

The `/prompt` command is a powerful tool that allows you to customize the behavior of the HeyMia chat bot. By providing text input, you can update the bot's responses and make it more responsive to your server's needs. If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to the HeyMia team for support.
